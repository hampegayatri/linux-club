Linux is the industry standard for application deployments in the form of computing servers, ftp servers, database servers, Cybersecurity, etc. As per our observations, most of the students don't use Linux-based Operating Systems just because, they don't know how to use one. We believe in a project-based approach to learn programming skills. 

# Our Goals:
- Develop essential CLI & Programming skills.
- Learn the working of Linux-based Operating Systems.
- Work with Linux Servers
- Improve Documentation & Technical Writing skills.
- Participate in Open source Programs, Competitions, Conferences, Hackathons, etc.
- Learn to practice DevOps.
- Get up & running with freelancing.
